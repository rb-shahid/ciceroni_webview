# Project Os - File Upload
Os-FileUp is an Android WebView Image Upload application developed to give you some idea how to deal with different Android versions' WebView for file uploading through file manager or camera.


## Getting Started
Project contains a completed android application build that you can download and can use directly, while following few steps will help you setup things in your own environment.

### Requirements
The project requires minimum Android API 16+ (4.1 JellyBean) SDK to test *(webview looks really bad in that though)*. And you can use any development software of your choice, I used Android Studio while developing this, also, try to keep your softwares, builds and SDKs updated. I try to keep my projects updated with latest builds.

### Test Run
Try rebuilding the project on your programming environment, once you are done fixing any error (incase if one came up), you'll be ready to look into the project.

### Permissions
You can remove any of the following requests if you do not need them or you can disable any feature using easy setup variables.
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```
`INTERNET` permission is required if you are requesting a weburl or webpage and `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`+`CAMERA` permissions are required for camera photo capture and creation.

`PROJECT NOTE: *Android 4.4 doesn't support webview upload default method and it's a permanent bug as no more KitKat updates are going to be made.*`

**A personal note:** `You all must keep up with programming. It's sometimes difficult and sometimes easy but fun afterall, you can create your own world with programming, that's the beauty of it. So, all the best for your next creation.`
